Even with overflow: hidden,\n// it still scrolls the page in many situations:\n//\n// 1. When the bottom toolbar and address bar are collapsed, page scrolling is always allowed.\n// 2. When the keyboard is visible, the viewport does not resize. Instead, the keyboard covers part of\n//    it, so it becomes scrollable.\n// 3. When tapping on an input, the page always scrolls so that the input is centered in the visual viewport.\n//    This may cause even fixed position elements to scroll off the screen.\n// 4. When using the next/previous buttons in the keyboard to navigate between inputs, the whole page always\n//    scrolls, even if the input is inside a nested scrollable element that could be scrolled instead.\n//\n// In order to work around these cases, and prevent scrolling without jankiness, we do a few things:\n//\n// 1. Prevent default on `touchmove` events that are not in a scrollable element. This prevents touch scrolling\n//    on the window.\n// 2. Prevent default on `touchmove` events inside a scrollable element when the scroll position is at the\n//    top or bottom. This avoids the whole page scrolling instead, but does prevent overscrolling.\n// 3. Prevent default on `touchend` events on input elements and handle focusing the element ourselves.\n// 4. When focusing an input, apply a transform to trick Safari into thinking the input is at the top\n//    of the page, which prevents it from scrolling the page. After the input is focused, scroll the element\n//    into view ourselves, without scrolling the whole page.\n// 5. Offset the body by the scroll position using a negative margin and scroll to the top. This should appear the\n//    same visually, but makes the actual scroll position always zero. This is required to make all of the\n//    above work or Safari will still try to scroll the page when focusing an input.\n// 6. As a last resort, handle window scroll events, and scroll back to the top. This can happen when attempting\n//    to navigate to an input with the next/previous buttons that's outside a modal.\nfunction preventScrollMobileSafari() {\n  let scrollable: Element;\n  let lastY = 0;\n  let onTouchStart = (e: TouchEvent) => {\n    // Store the nearest scrollable parent element from the element that the user touched.\n    scrollable = getScrollParent(e.target as Element);\n    if (scrollable === document.documentElement && scrollable === document.body) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    lastY = e.changedTouches[0].pageY;\n  };\n\n  let onTouchMove = (e: TouchEvent) => {\n    // Prevent scrolling the window.\n    if (scrollable === document.documentElement || scrollable === document.body) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // Prevent scrolling up when at the top and scrolling down when at the bottom\n    // of a nested scrollable area, otherwise mobile Safari will start scrolling\n    // the window instead.
